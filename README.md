# Welfare_Spending_and_Incarceration

This project explores the relationship between US state's spending on welfare programs and the percent of the state's population under criminal justice control (includes probation, parole, jail, jail supervision - such as house arrest on GPS monitoring - and prison). The method used is a state-fixed effects regression.
